<h4>7. CONSEQUENCES</h4>
<p><strong>7.1 </strong>School rules are established to maintain a safe and
positive learning environment for all students. The school adopts a three-tiered
approach to behaviour management; promote and prevent, address and correct,
and replace and restore. We promote positive behaviour and prevent issues
through a supportive school culture, address and correct misbehaviour promptly
to minimise disruption to learning, and help students replace inappropriate
actions with positive ones while restoring relationships.</p>
<p><strong>7.2 </strong>Consequences will be administered based on the nature
and severity of the offence. These may include in-school or out-of-school
suspension, adjustment of conduct grade, supervised movements, behaviour
contracts, loss of privileges, eligibility for awards, and leadership opportunities.
The application of consequences aims to support students in demonstrating
responsibility and self-discipline and ensure that the environment in the
school remains caring and enabling for all students and staff.</p>
