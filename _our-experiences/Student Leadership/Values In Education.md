### **Values-in-Education**
This is how VIA is progressively planned and implemented in TGPS. Each block of level has different focus area and at the end of six years, we feel that our students will have a clearer picture of the issues faced within the society and they can do something within their means to address it as well. With this framework, we aim to have every level do its part and pay it forward to the community.
