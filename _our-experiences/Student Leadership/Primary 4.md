Hence, we partnered the Town council to help the residents with any of their impending issue. |<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> P4 level is exposed to many different forms of learning opportunities in school. Coding is one example of it. Hence, we wanted to incorporate this into a project that would benefit the neighbourhood as well. In order to raise the awareness of the residents about recycling, we decided to create ‘Talking Bins’ to attract and educate the residents about recycling. |
