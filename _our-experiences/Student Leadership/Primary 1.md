### **Primary 1**

| Experience | Impact | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **VIA Booklets**<br>- Includes tasks that show how our pupils put our school values into their everyday actions. <br><br>- Activities target at simple Housekeeping skills. | Pupils will learn to be more responsible and have better sense of ownership in  managing themselves. | We believe that everyone can contribute and pay it forward no matter how young they are. Hence, this booklet will allow them to understand that they can be more responsible for their own actions. |
| **Collaboration with SPCA**<br>- Attend talks from SPCA to increase their awareness level<br><br>- Make animal paper origami to support the P2s awareness day | Pupils will learn to be more responsible and have better sense of ownership in  managing themselves as well as helping others around them. [Eg: Family]<br>  | In Primary 2, pupilâ€™s impact level would expand from themselves to helping their immediate environment such as their family. As such, their skills and activities will be targeted at how they can play their part at home by performing simple household chores. |
