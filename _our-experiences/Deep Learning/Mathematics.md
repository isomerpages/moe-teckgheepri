### **Mathematics**

Mathematics Department<br>
Engaged Learners, Life-Long Problem Solvers
  
In Teck Ghee Primary School, we aim to create a positive mathematical experience that will allow students to reason, communicate and think critically to prepare them to be life-long problem solvers and at the same time develop their numeracy skills and prepare them to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

#### **Key Programmes**
##### **Meaningful experiential and authentic learning**
Activity-Based lessons are carefully designed to create authentic learning experiences for the pupils. The use of visual representations using concrete manipulatives makes learning a more hands-on learning experience. Learners will then be able to understand the pictorial examples by relating to concrete examples and apply them to abstract Mathematical concepts.

##### **Developing Problem Solvers through Heuristics and Investigative Tasks**
Excel in Heuristics is an in-house heuristics programme designed to equip our learners with strategies to solve mathematical problems. Different heuristics have been identified at each level to ensure that pupils are equipped with the necessary skills when doing word problems. Our in-house worksheets are deigned by our teachers to cater to the different abilities and needs of our pupils. A spiral approach is adopted in the design of the programme to ensure that pupils build on their skills over the 6 years in Teck Ghee Primary School.

##### **Math for all**
To cater to the varying abilities and interests of our Math learners, TGPS has various carefully thought out programmes to build and stretch our learners’ abilities.

*   Differentiated Curriculum  
*   Mathematics Olympiad Courses  
*   Learning Support for Mathematics  
*   Tinkering with Mathematics Programme

##### **Differentiated Curriculum**
P3 to P6 pupils are banded into the various learning groups to allow teachers to better customise teaching instructions, resources and activities to meet pupils’ needs. Learners with more advanced knowledge and interests get to stretch their abilities by engaging in high-order activities while others can have the flexibility to learn at their own pace with smaller teacher-pupil ratio.

##### **Mathematics Olympiad Courses**
Our Mathematics Olympiad course are conducted to stretch our pupils’ mathematical competency and aptitude. Selected pupils will get to explore their interest in Mathematics and develop problem solving abilities. We aim to help pupils appreciate the use of different strategies to solve non-routine problems and provide opportunities for pupils to think about, discuss and apply strategies<br>
These pupils are also given the opportunities to take part in Mathematics competitions, thus giving them an opportunity to discover their talent in Mathematics and benchmark their Mathematics standards against their peers

##### **Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)**
Our Learning Support for Mathematics programme aims to support selected Primary 1 and 2 pupils who have difficulty in basic numeracy. We aim to build their confidence and inculcate positive beliefs about their ability to solve Math problems. The LSM lessons are conducted with smaller sized groups to ensure that these pupils receive help in areas that they are weak in. This programme will give more opportunities for pupils to experience success in Mathematics.

##### **Tinkering with Mathematics Programme (TMP)**
The TMP is a Mathematics enrichment programme for selected Primary 4 pupils who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop in pupils mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Under the guidance of our trained teachers, pupils will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematics explorations which are specially designed for the programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help pupils to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess, as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.
