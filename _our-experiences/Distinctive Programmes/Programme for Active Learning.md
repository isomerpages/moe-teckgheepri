| Visual Arts | Visual arts serves as a platform to introduce pupils to the culture, lifestyle, and unique features of various countries.

It provides opportunities for pupils to express confidence in their work and express themselves effectively, exhibit curiosity and good learning attitudes, and to enjoy group experiences and teamwork.   <br>Through the activities during PAL lessons, we hope to promote a greater sense of awareness in pupils both about themselves and about others. Through the activities, we also hope to help pupils understand themselves better and to develop a sense of empathy in them. |
| Outdoor Education | The OE module aims to cultivate in pupils a deeper appreciation of nature around us, as well as educating pupils on how we can take better care of our natural resources and environment. This module also serves as a soft introduction to science, as pupils will employ the basic scientific skills such as observation and comparison in their PAL lessons. Lessons are infused with scientific concepts that are taught in a fun and engaging way so that pupils gain a basic understanding of the general concept. |

##### **Programme for Active Learning (PAL) – Primary One**
Teck Ghee Primary School embarks on Programme for Active Learning (PAL) this year for all our Primary 1 pupils.<br>
Here are the details of the four modules:

Students will have a series of discovery throughout the 7 sessions as they travel around the world, namely Thailand, Philippines and Korea. They will encounter different sights, sounds and cultures. Students will learn about traditional Thai dance using paper nails, Korean pop culture and Philippines folk dance. Through the choreography and exploration of dance sequence, group formation and creative steps, students learn to work together and be confident communicators. In the process, students learn to persevere and take turns through the group activities. They are given the platform to express themselves by creating and improvising their own dance steps.

In the visual arts module, pupils will be issued a “passport” and then proceed to “visit” countries around the region and the world. They will be introduced to these countries through their arts, landmarks, culture, and other unique aspects of the countries. After learning more about each country, the pupils will have a hands-on session to create something that relates to each country, for example, a moon kite, or wau bulan, during the lesson when they “visit” Malaysia. Primary 1 pupils will be “travelling” to countries in the region, and Primary 2 pupils will venture further “abroad” to other countries of the world.  
  
*   **Outdoor Education Module**<br>
The focus of the sports and games module in Primary 2 is to develop pupils’ self-management through group activities. During PAL lessons, pupils will be exposed to working in groups to complete simple activities and challenges. In the process, they will be presented with opportunities to resolve conflicts and find compromises, through which they will learn to recognize and manage their emotions and reactions to achieve a desirable outcome.

The focus of the sports and games module for Primary 1 is to develop pupils’ self-awareness through games and physical activities.
