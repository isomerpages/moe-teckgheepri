Our P6 students are involved in the Code for Fun Programme as part of their Post PSLE activity.  In the videos below, our students are learning about Computational Thinking through Sphero

iMad Day is a day dedicated to Innovation, Music, Art, and Dance, usually held during our Back-to-School Programme. Our aim is to expose students to different art and music forms and to encourage creativity and self-expression through art and music creation and innovation.
