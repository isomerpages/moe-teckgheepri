![](/images/Champs%202024/6_Art.png)

In Teck Ghee Primary School, our Visual Art curriculum is planned with the MOE’s values and aims for Art Education in mind.&nbsp;
  
The value of Art in curriculum:
**Art...**<br>
*   fosters students’ **sense of identity, culture and place in society**&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   builds students’ capacity to **critically discern** and **process visual information**, and **communicate effectively** in the 21st century and
*   **expands imagination and creativity**

The aims of art education in TGPS are to enable every child to:&nbsp;
*   **enjoy art,**
*   **communicate visually**, and
*   **make meaning** through **connecting with society and culture.**
