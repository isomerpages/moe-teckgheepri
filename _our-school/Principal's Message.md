<h4><strong>Welcome to TGPS!</strong></h4>
<p>I am honoured to be part of a community that is committed to bringing
out the brilliance of Minds and Hearts in every student, whom we fondly
address as a ‘TGStar’. Our environment provides rich opportunities for
students to live out what it means to be ‘Tomorrow’s Leaders, Today’.</p>
<p>Our mission shapes everything we do, focusing on developing all our students
into: Creative Thinkers, Confident Communicators, Lifelong Learners, and
Responsible Citizens. We achieve this through a positive, caring learning
community and strong partnerships with our stakeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Leading in Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>As we foster a spirit of<strong> Growth Mindset </strong>in every child,
we would like them to learn how to enjoy learning, and how to internalise
learning through a range of rich, authentic curriculum experiences that
foster Deep Learning. At the heart of it, we want every student to know
that they <strong>can</strong> learn and are <strong>capable</strong> of learning
in different ways. Forging a spirit of inclusivity, we believe in collective
success, celebrating the growth of the teams be it class, CCAs or within
any groups that our students are in. Encouraging our students to work for
the collective good of one another has created a culture where Peer Support
is strengthened and being together in the journey of education has become
a joyful endeavour.</p>
<p>Our journey in establishing a solid foundation in learning is possible
thanks to our highly competent and passionate group of educators and staff
who are unwavering in providing customised support to our students’ learning.</p>
<p><strong>Leading in Wellbeing</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe in establishing strong relationships with self, peers, teachers
and family members as they are the key building blocks to enhancing wellbeing.
We have also thoughtfully designed platforms and lessons for students to
learn and live out the attitude of <strong>Gratitude</strong>, manage their
emotions and exercise executive functioning. These intentional acts of
teaching the skills of wellbeing complement our efforts to strengthen academic
skills in our TGStars.</p>
<p>Whether through sports, arts, music, or community service, we strive to
offer a well-rounded experience that encourages growth beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>As we move forward, our commitment to empowering students in their learning
and wellbeing remains unwavering. With the support of our entire community—including
the School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, students, parents,
teachers, and staff—we are confident that every TGStar who walks through
our doors will shine brilliantly.</p>
<p>We invite our entire community to join us in fostering an environment
where every TGStar can thrive. Together, we can make this year a success!</p>
<p>Warmest regards,</p>
<p>Ms Rezia Rahumathullah</p>
