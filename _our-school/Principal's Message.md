As futurist and philosopher Alvin Toffler once wrote: "**_The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn._**"

Indeed, while we cannot accurately ‘predict’ the future, what we are well-positioned to do today is to prepare our children to acquire the right values, attitudes and dispositions to **_learn for life and throughout life_**.  It is through learning that they can make sense of the connected but complex world where they have to navigate around emerging trends and learn to how to self-organise to anticipate and respond to problems.

In TGPS, we take pride in **Nurturing Tomorrow’s Leaders, Today**! We do this by:<br>
\- _Cultivating the Joy of Learning_ through [Deep Learning](https://staging.d3od0h9ii8slt3.amplifyapp.com/our-experiences/deep-learning/)<br>
\- _Building Resilience & Strengthening Relationships_ through [Positive Education](https://staging.d3od0h9ii8slt3.amplifyapp.com/our-experiences/positive-education/)<br>
\- _Achieving Well-Balanced Development_ through [Active and Healthy Living](https://staging.d3od0h9ii8slt3.amplifyapp.com/our-experiences/active-and-healthy-living/cca/sports/)<br>
\- _Making Learning Come Alive_ through [Distinctive Programmes](https://staging.d3od0h9ii8slt3.amplifyapp.com/our-experiences/distinctive-programmes/)<br>
\- _Developing Servant Leaders_ through [Student Leadership](https://staging.d3od0h9ii8slt3.amplifyapp.com/our-experiences/student-leadership/vie/)

Through our various holistic programmes and activities that are thoughtfully curated by our team of dedicated teachers and staff, we are confident that all our students will, by the end of their six-year journey with us, become TGStars - students who will be well-positioned to serve and lead in whichever capacity that they so wish to in future when they have the opportunity to contribute to our society both locally and globally.

We have just celebrated our 20th anniversary (TG20) in 2022 and beyond TG20, we aspire that:
</br>●	Our TGStars will always be the pride of our community and nation - where they will always find meaningful ways to give back and serve in whichever capacity that their passion and interest will take them in their lives;</br>
●	TGPS will always be the school for the community - where we will always endeavor to Nurture Tomorrow’s Leaders, Today. 

This is our promise and commitment to all our TGStars, stakeholders and partners, and to Singapore!

With Gratitude,


With Gratitude,<br>
**Mr. Wong Jia Wang**<br>
