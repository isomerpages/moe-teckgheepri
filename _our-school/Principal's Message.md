<h4><strong>A Place where EVERY TGStar Shines</strong></h4>
<p>It is with great excitement and honour that I assume the role of Principal
at Teck Ghee Primary School. The institution's strong identity and values
of <strong>Team Spirit</strong>, <strong>Graciousness</strong>, <strong>Perseverance</strong>,
and <strong>Self-Discipline</strong> are truly inspiring, resonating not
only in the hearts of our students and staff but echoing through every
space within our school. I would like to express my deepest appreciation
for the exemplary leadership provided by Mr. Wong Jia Wang and the principals
before him, which has laid a robust foundation for Teck Ghee's success.</p>
<p>Fondly addressing our students as <strong>TG</strong>Stars, we firmly believe
in the potential of each child to shine brightly within themselves and
for those around them. Teck Ghee Primary is a place where student experiences,
both in and out of the classroom, are curated to bring out the best in
every child. We provide opportunities to cultivate the uniqueness of each
individual, celebrating progress at various phases in their learning journey.</p>
<p>Learning at Teck Ghee Primary is designed for students to pursue their
interests, acquire skills and dispositions through subject mastery while
finding joy in meaningful engagement with peers, teachers, and the community.
Our curriculum places a strong emphasis on 21st-century competencies and
seamless technology integration, fostering a holistic educational experience.
This empowers students to collaborate, problem-solve, and express themselves
in a fail-safe environment. The high level of engagement, anchored by strong
student-teacher relationships and connections with key partners, will enable
learners to have the zest for learning and the passion to enhance their
wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recognize the critical role parents play in a child's education, and
I am committed to fostering a strong partnership with you. We believe that
collaboration between home and school is essential for the success of our
TGStars. Your insights, support, and active involvement in your child's
education are invaluable. Together, let us create an environment where
every child can thrive.</p>
<p>I look forward to celebrating each one of our TGStars, ensuring that every
child appreciates their unique individuality. It is my heartfelt wish that
our students will embody the best version of themselves, not just for personal
growth but as a shining example for their friends, family, and the broader
community.</p>
<p>Joining me on this journey are my Vice Principals, Mrs Celia Lau (VP/Academic)
and Mr Jet Tan (VP/Admin), who will work alongside our highly committed
teachers to make 2024 a year filled with engagement and meaningful experiences,
dedicated to nurturing <strong>Leaders of Tomorrow</strong>, <strong>Today</strong>.</p>
<p>Yours in service,
<br>Ms Rezia Rahumathullah
<br>Principal
<br>Teck Ghee Primary School</p>
