<h4><strong>Principal’s Message</strong></h4>
<p>Welcome to the new school year! I am delighted to begin 2026 with you
and our TGStars as we continue to shape a school experience that places
strong emphasis on developing <strong>Leaders of Learning and Wellbeing</strong>.</p>
<p>At the heart of our work is the belief that children thrive when they
feel confident, valued, and supported. When students learn to manage their
emotions, build positive friendships, and develop healthy habits, they
grow in confidence and purpose. Through our core values of <strong>Team Spirit, Graciousness, Perseverance, and Self-Discipline</strong>,
we guide our TGStars to care for others, keep trying even when learning
is challenging, and take pride in doing their best.</p>
<p>We encourage our students to be active participants in their learning.
Whether in the classroom or through outdoor and experiential learning,
our TGStars are given opportunities to put their strengths into action,
learn with and from their peers, and take increasing ownership of their
learning journey.</p>
<p>We know that we cannot do this alone. Supporting our students as <strong>Leaders of Tomorrow, Today</strong> is
a partnership between school and home. We warmly invite parents and caregivers
to work closely with us, to share a common language of strengths and values,
and to celebrate every step of your child’s growth along the way.</p>
<p>I look forward to a year of learning, growth, and shared successes with
you and our TGStars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warmest regards,
<br>Ms Rezia Rahumathullah</p>
