### **Cyber Safety**
#### **Our Cyberwellness Pledge**
The Internet is where I can learn and play. I pledge to have good and healthy online habits and to make it safe for me and you:

\- I will keep my personal information (e.g. name, age, address, phone number, photograph) private.<br>
\-  I will only chat online with people I know in real life and avoid meeting up with anyone I do not know in real life.

\- I will obey the age requirements of all online accounts (e.g. social media, video, chat services).<br>
\- I will practise healthy online habits (e.g. limit my time online, take regular breaks from online activities, avoid Internet use before bedtime).
