<p>The school crest comprises of <strong>a star, a globe, the constellation</strong> and <strong>a pair of wings</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The star</strong> symbolizes our belief that every child can realise
his or her potential to shine brightly, and we aspire to bring out the
star quality in each of them.</p>
<p><strong>The globe</strong> represents the important part our students can
play in the global and local communities.</p>
<p><strong>The constellation </strong>represents our journey of lifelong
learning and construction of new knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>The pair of wings</strong> symbolizes the school soaring to greater
heights, in search of higher aspirations and excellence.</p>
<p>Our motto ‘Aspire and Achieve’ urges teachers and students to be anchored
on strong moral values, set their sights high, and strive towards a common
goal.</p>
<p>The pillar with the core values, ‘TGPS’, represents our effort in achieving
our aspirations. Our core values are <strong>T</strong>eam Spirit, <strong>G</strong>raciousness, <strong>P</strong>erseverance
and <strong>S</strong>elf-Discipline.</p>
