<h2><strong><u>Environmental Science</u></strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>The Environmental Science Club is involved in a diversity of programmes
aimed at promoting environmental consciousness and protecting the environment.
Members will contribute by providing creative ideas on how to initiate
and organise programmes in line with the Club's objectives as well as in
participating in hands-on "green" and Science activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Environmental Science Club is a CCA that encourages students to be environmentally
friendly through reducing, reusing and recycling. Students can learn about
the biodiversity around them and what they can do to conserve them. ICT
and Multimedia is deeply integrated in these activities where pupils are
expected to embark on projects based on environmental and sustainability
issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The club also provides opportunities for the students to experience first-hand,
the process of exploring, investigating and discovering new knowledge in
Science. Furthermore, students are also given the opportunity to create
products using recycled materials through upcycling projects.</p>
<p>Students also get to complete Young Scientists cards to address issues
like climate change, water and energy conservation and understanding sustainability
issues. Students also have hands-on experiences in converting food waste
into usable compost. This compost is used to fertilise the soil in our
garden. This further educates students about sustainability education.
Students also have the opportunity to design posters about environmental
events like World Water Day and Earth Day after which they would make a
presentation to their peers&nbsp; during&nbsp; CCA or the school assembly
programme.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Aims:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To promote greater public awareness of and concern for the living and
natural environment in our school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage our students to be more environmentally conscious and display
a greater sense of environmental responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To arouse curiosity and heighten interest in Science.</p>
