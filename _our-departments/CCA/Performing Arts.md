<h2><strong><u>Choir CCA</u></strong></h2>
<p>The students have been exposed to a wide array of songs ranging from classical
to modern familiar pieces. On top of that, the students learn to sing songs
from different languages such as Korean, Japanese to Latin American. A
professional and experienced choir conductor will conduct the sessions.
The weekly trainings serve to provide opportunities for talented students
to represent the school in the Singapore International Choral Festival
or the Singapore Youth Festival Presentation. The choir had the opportunity
to perform in the National Day Observance Ceremony and various school events.
The choir had a tremendously fruitful SYF preparation in the last Presentation
in SOTA. Students toiled and learnt what it meant to work with team spirit
and perseverance. Students had achieved the Certificate of Participation
during the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation in 2022.</p>
