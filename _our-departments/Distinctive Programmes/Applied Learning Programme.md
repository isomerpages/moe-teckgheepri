### **Applied Learning Programme**
We aim to raise pupils’ awareness and promote a sense of responsibility towards the environment through various platforms that allow for engaged learning.  This will lead to the fostering of important lifelong skills and values for our pupils to be environmentally aware and ecologically responsible.

#### **Applied Learning Programme**
Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to educate and promote sustainability education using authentic real-life issues related to Singapore like urban farming and reducing food waste. Having limited land space and resources, we strive to optimise current resources to achieve sustainability for future generations. With the school’s motto “Nurturing Tomorrow’s Leaders Today” in mind, students will be environmental advocates who will inculcate and lead in conservation efforts as a way of life.

At the end of the six-year primary school education, we aim to develop students who:

*   Are curious to learn
*   Dare to explore the feasibility of different solutions to authentic issues
*   Are able to empathise with others and make a difference
*   Are able to communicate ideas effectively and convince others
