### **Music**
#### **Music in TGPS**
In TGPS, we strive to&nbsp;**develop character**&nbsp;and build capability and capacity of every student holistically. A tiered approach is adopted to teach Music, building on fundamentals and&nbsp;musical skills.&nbsp;We provide opportunities for&nbsp;**collaborative learning**&nbsp;among students through&nbsp;participation in ensemble performances in both instrumental and vocal settings.&nbsp;

Through designing&nbsp;**student-centric**&nbsp;activities, we hope to equip students with skills to understand musical elements and concepts. Students are given the music exposure by learning a variety of instruments and learn to&nbsp;**appreciate the Arts**&nbsp;through various platforms.

#### **From our Students to You**
The following song is performed by our students as part of their ukulele programme. They also wrote its lyrics. The design brief was to send a positive encouragement to their peers in this challenging period. What better way to pen down our thoughts through a song and to look back at this period, knowing that we have grown together not only mentally, emotionally but also musically. Enjoy!
