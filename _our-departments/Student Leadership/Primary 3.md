<br>Students will understand how important it is to keep their environment
clean and we hope that through this, we can also raise our students' awareness
about food wastage.

<br>P3s will be the ambassadors of promoting 3Rs and even beyond that where

<br>The school wanted the P3s to be more aware of the 3Rs and to go one step
above recycling. We decided that P3s can be involved in upcycling recyclables
materials.
<br>
<br>This is integrated with Project Work where students will do up an upcycled
product and this will be on display for the rest of the school to see and
understand how waste materials can be turned into interesting products.
Our P3 level would serve as an inspiration to the rest where we want them
to think twice before disposing any waste materials.</p>
