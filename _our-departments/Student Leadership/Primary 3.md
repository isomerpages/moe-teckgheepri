### **Primary 3**

| Experiences | Impact | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Use Your Hands Campaign**<br>- Classes are scheduled to clean the canteen tables after the first recess bell goes off.<br><br>- They will wipe the tables and proceed to their classes when the 2nd bell is rung.<br><br><br>**Upcycling recyclable materials**<br>- Collect recyclable materials and upcycle it to continue its usage.<br><br>- Integrated with Project work<br>* using design thinking framework | <br><br>Pupils will understand how important it is to keep their environment clean and we hope that through this, we can also raise our pupils awareness about food wastage.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>P3s will be the ambassadors of promoting 3Rs and even beyond that where they will upcycle these recyclable products. | <br><br><br><br>The school wanted the P3s to be more aware of the 3Rs and to go one step above recycling. We decided that P3s can be involved in upcycling recyclables materials.<br><br>This is integrated with Project Work where pupils will do up an upcycled product and this will be on display for the rest of the school to see and understand how waste materials can be turned into interesting products. Our P3 level would serve as an inspiration to the rest where we want them to think twice before disposing any waste materials. |
