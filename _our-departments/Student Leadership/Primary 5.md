<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The school is situated in a location where it surrounded by higher percentage
of elderly citizens. As such, we wanted our upper primary students to focus
on the aged within the neighbourhood instead of picking any other organisation
at random. Activities such as workshops being organised by students for
the elderly will not only benefit the elderly but we believe that the students
can also learn a lot from them. This two way partnership allows for greater
learning to take place and such experiential learning speaks volumes within
the childâ€™s holistic development.</p>
