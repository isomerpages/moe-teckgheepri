<h5><strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL) – Primary One</strong></h5>
<p>Teck Ghee Primary School embarks on Programme for Active Learning (PAL)
this year for all our Primary 1 students.
<br>Here are the details of the four modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Performing Arts Module</strong>
<br>Students will have a series of discovery throughout the 7 sessions as
they travel around the world, namely Thailand, Philippines and Korea. They
will encounter different sights, sounds and cultures. Students will learn
about traditional Thai dance using paper nails, Korean pop culture and
Philippines folk dance. Through the choreography and exploration of dance
sequence, group formation and creative steps, students learn to work together
and be confident communicators. In the process, students learn to persevere
and take turns through the group activities. They are given the platform
to express themselves by creating and improvising their own dance steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visual Arts Module</strong>
<br>In the visual arts module, students will be issued a “passport” and then
proceed to “visit” countries around the region and the world. They will
be introduced to these countries through their arts, landmarks, culture,
and other unique aspects of the countries. After learning more about each
country, the students will have a hands-on session to create something
that relates to each country, for example, a moon kite, or wau bulan, during
the lesson when they “visit” Malaysia. Primary 1 students will be “travelling”
to countries in the region, and Primary 2 students will venture further
“abroad” to other countries of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outdoor Education Module</strong>
<br>The focus of the sports and games module in Primary 2 is to develop students’
self-management through group activities. During PAL lessons, students
will be exposed to working in groups to complete simple activities and
challenges. In the process, they will be presented with opportunities to
resolve conflicts and find compromises, through which they will learn to
recognize and manage their emotions and reactions to achieve a desirable
outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sports and Games Module</strong>
<br>The focus of the sports and games module for Primary 1 is to develop students’
self-awareness through games and physical activities. As part of the lessons,
the students will be introduced to situations through which their teachers
are able to question them and prompt them to think about and recognize
their feelings and emotions, and why they feel that way.</p>
