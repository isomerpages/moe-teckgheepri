<h3><strong>Music</strong></h3>
<p>In TGPS, we strive to&nbsp;<strong>develop character</strong>&nbsp;and
build capability and capacity of every student holistically. A tiered approach
is adopted to teach Music, building on fundamentals and&nbsp;musical skills.&nbsp;We
provide opportunities for&nbsp;<strong>collaborative learning</strong>&nbsp;among
students through&nbsp;participation in ensemble performances in both instrumental
and vocal settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through designing&nbsp;<strong>student-centric</strong>&nbsp;activities,
we hope to equip students with skills to understand musical elements and
concepts. Students are given the music exposure by learning a variety of
instruments and learn to&nbsp;<strong>appreciate the Arts</strong>&nbsp;through
various platforms.</p>

<h4><strong>From our Students to You</strong></h4>
<p>The following song is performed by our students as part of their ukulele
programme. They also wrote its lyrics. The design brief was to send a positive
encouragement to their peers in this challenging period. What better way
to pen down our thoughts through a song and to look back at this period,
knowing that we have grown together not only mentally, emotionally but
also musically. Enjoy!</p>
