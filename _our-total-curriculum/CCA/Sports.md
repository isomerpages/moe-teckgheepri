<h3><strong><u>Netball (Girls)</u></strong></h3>
<p>Netball in TGPS is a platform where girls not only learn how to play the
game but they will also improve in agility and ball handling skills with
the guidance of an experienced coach. Netball being a team sport also requires
the girls to communicate and work well with others.&nbsp;

<br>The ones who play together stay together. Training and participating in
competitions will provide the girls with wonderful opportunities to learn
self-discipline, to persevere and grow, to build life-long friendships
and create lasting memories on and off the court.&nbsp;</p>
