<h3><strong><u>Environmental Science</u></strong></h3>
<p>The Environmental Science Club is involved in a diversity of programmes
aimed at promoting environmental consciousness and protecting the environment.
Members will contribute by providing creative ideas on how to initiate
and organise programmes in line with the Club's objectives as well as in
participating in hands-on "green" and Science activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Environmental Science Club is a CCA that encourages pupils to be environmentally
friendly through reducing, reusing and recycling. Pupils can learn about
the biodiversity around them and what they can do to conserve them. ICT
and Multimedia is deeply integrated in these activities where pupils are
expected to embark on projects based on environmental and sustainability
issues.</p>
<p>The club also provides opportunities for the pupils to experience first-hand,
the process of exploring, investigating and discovering new knowledge in
Science. Furthermore, pupils are also given the opportunity to create products
using recycled materials through upcycling projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pupils also get to complete Young Scientists cards to address issues like
climate change, water and energy conservation and understanding sustainability
issues. Students also have hands-on experiences in converting food waste
into usable compost. This compost is used to fertilise the soil in our
garden. This further educates pupils about sustainability education. Students
also have the opportunity to design posters about environmental events
like World Water Day and Earth Day after which they would make a presentation
to their peers&nbsp; during&nbsp; CCA or the school assembly programme.</p>
<p><strong>Aims:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To promote greater public awareness of and concern for the living and
natural environment in our school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage our students to be more environmentally conscious and display
a greater sense of environmental responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To arouse curiosity and heighten interest in Science.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Core Values:</strong>
<br>All the programmes which are planned for our pupils are all in line with
our objectives to instill the core values such as team spirit, graciousness,
perseverance and self-discipline in our pupils.</p>
