<p>In Teck Ghee Primary School, we aim to create a positive mathematical
experience that will allow students to reason, communicate and think critically
to prepare them to be life-long problem solvers and at the same time develop
their numeracy skills and prepare them to meet the challenges of the 21st
century. Deep Learning of Mathematics is achieved through the skillful
teaching of concepts, skills and processes and the nurturing of metacognition
and positive attitudes.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Meaningful experiential and authentic learning</strong></h4>
<p>Activity-Based lessons are carefully designed to create authentic learning
experiences for the students. The use of visual representations using concrete
manipulatives makes learning a more hands-on learning experience. Learners
will then be able to understand the pictorial examples by relating to concrete
examples and apply them to abstract Mathematical concepts.</p>
<h4><strong>Developing Problem Solvers through Heuristics and Investigative Tasks</strong></h4>
<p>Excel in Heuristics is an in-house heuristics programme designed to equip
our learners with strategies to solve mathematical problems. Different
heuristics have been identified at each level to ensure that students are
equipped with the necessary skills when doing word problems. Our in-house
worksheets are deigned by our teachers to cater to the different abilities
and needs of our students. A spiral approach is adopted in the design of
the programme to ensure that students build on their skills over the 6
years in Teck Ghee Primary School.</p>
<h4><strong>Math for all</strong></h4>
<p>To cater to the varying abilities and interests of our Math learners,
TGPS has various carefully curated programmes to build and stretch our
learners’ abilities.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Differentiated Curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning Support for Mathematics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tinkering with Mathematics Programme</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Differentiated Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>P3 to P6 students are banded into the various learning groups to allow
teachers to better customise teaching instructions, resources and activities
to meet students’ needs. Learners with more advanced knowledge and interests
get to stretch their abilities by engaging in high-order activities while
others can have the flexibility to learn at their own pace with smaller
teacher-student ratio.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</strong></h4>
<p>Our Learning Support for Mathematics programme aims to support selected
Primary 1 and 2 students who have difficulty in basic numeracy. We aim
to build their confidence and inculcate positive beliefs about their ability
to solve Math problems. The LSM lessons are conducted with smaller sized
groups to ensure that these students receive help in areas that they are
weak in. This programme will give more opportunities for students to experience
success in Mathematics.</p>
<h4><strong>Tinkering with Mathematics Programme (TMP)</strong></h4>
<p>The TMP is a Mathematics enrichment programme for selected Primary 4 students
who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop
in students mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding
through an inquiry approach. Under the guidance of our trained teachers,
students will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage
in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematics
explorations which are specially designed for the programme. The rich learning
experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to develop
the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess, as well
as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive
thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
