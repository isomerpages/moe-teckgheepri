<h3><strong>Student Management</strong></h3>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to teach students to manage their own behaviours,
rather than relying on external controls, so that they continue to be successful
when we are not with them. When students make wrong choices, the school
will instil discipline and guide them to make responsible decisions the
next time.</p>
<p>We guide our students to manage their own behaviour through the Stop-Think-Do
principles and 3 Golden Rules.</p>
