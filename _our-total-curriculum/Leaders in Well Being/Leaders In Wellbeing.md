<h2><strong>Leaders in Well-Being&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Our Leaders in Well-Being journey celebrates every child’s unique strengths,
encouraging them to lead with empathy, resilience, and purpose. Through
diverse student development experiences, including leadership roles, peer
support, Values-in-Action, and well-being initiatives, students use their
voice and agency to drive positive change in their community. They learn
to reflect, set goals, and persevere with a growth mindset, recognizing
that well-being is nurtured by self-awareness, compassion, and meaningful
connections. Consequently, each student grows into a caring, grounded,
and confident individual who contributes to the collective good.&nbsp;</p>
