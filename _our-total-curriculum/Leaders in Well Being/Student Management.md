<h3><strong>Student Management</strong></h3>
<p>The school adopts a three-tiered approach to behaviour management; promote
and prevent, address and correct, and replace and restore. We promote positive
behaviour and prevent issues through a supportive school culture, address
and correct misbehaviour promptly to minimise disruption to learning, and
help students replace inappropriate actions with positive ones while restoring
relationships.</p>
