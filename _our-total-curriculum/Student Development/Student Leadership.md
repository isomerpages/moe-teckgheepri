<p>### <strong>Student Leadership</strong>
</p>
<p>#### <strong>Values-in-Education</strong>
</p>
<p>In Teck Ghee Primary School, every child is given the opportunity to empathise
and display their leadership skills in various platforms.</p>
<p>One of which is during the Values-In-Action project which culminates to
a day called Gives Back Day of TGPS. Students from different levels dedicate
this day to show their empathy and pay forward their kindness to the community
in their own little unique way.</p>
<p>Students from some levels seek to understand the struggles of certain
groups of people within the community and makes use of this day as a platform
to reach out to them. We hope this meaningful journey continues to inspire
our TGSTARS and to always give their best to others.</p>

<p>#### <strong>Our Prefects</strong>
</p>
<p>Our prefects serve as a role-model to the rest of the student population.
For the past 2 years, they have been participating in the ‘Play Inclusive
event’. Play Inclusive is a programme where students with special needs
are engaged through sports to create a more inclusive society. In TGPS,
we provide this opportunity for the prefects to engage students from the
participating school and join them in this journey.</p>
<p>In 2020, due to COVID restrictions, Play Inclusive took place over a blend
of virtual platform and face to face interaction for the first time. We
aim to have our prefects have more of such opportunities to serve and be
role model to the rest of the students.</p>
