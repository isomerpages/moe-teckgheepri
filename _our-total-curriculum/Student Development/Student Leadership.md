<h1><strong>Student Leadership</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>Our Prefects</strong></h4>
<p>Our prefects serve as a role-model to the rest of the student population.
For the past 2 years, they have been participating in the ‘Play Inclusive
event’. Play Inclusive is a programme where students with special needs
are engaged through sports to create a more inclusive society. In TGPS,
we provide this opportunity for the prefects to engage students from the
participating school and join them in this journey.</p>
<p>In 2020, due to COVID restrictions, Play Inclusive took place over a blend
of virtual platform and face to face interaction for the first time. We
aim to have our prefects have more of such opportunities to serve and be
role model to the rest of the students.</p>
