<br>P4 level is exposed to many different forms of learning opportunities
in school. Coding is one example of it. Hence, we wanted to incorporate
this into a project that would benefit the neighbourhood as well. In order
to raise the awareness of the residents about recycling, we decided to
create ‘Talking Bins’ to attract and educate the residents about recycling.</p>
