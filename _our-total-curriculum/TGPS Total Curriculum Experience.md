<h4><strong>TGPS Total Curriculum Experience</strong> – Whole-School, Whole-Child Approach</h4>
<p>The synergy between Leaders in Learning and Leaders in Wellbeing creates
the Total Curriculum Experience at TGPS, a holistic approach that develops
both the mind and the heart. Anchored in a strengths-based philosophy,
our integrated programmes cultivate a growth mindset while significantly
amplifying students’ voice and agency in shaping their academic and personal
journeys. They become empowered young leaders who learn with purpose, act
with empathy, and inspire others to make a positive difference in the world
to become Creative Thinkers, Confident Communicators, Lifelong Learners,
and Responsible Citizens.</p>
