#### **Environmental Science**
The Environmental Science Club is involved in a diversity of programmes aimed at promoting environmental consciousness and protecting the environment. Members will contribute by providing creative ideas on how to initiate and organise programmes in line with the Club's objectives as well as in participating in hands-on "green" and Science activities.&nbsp;

The Environmental Science Club is a CCA that teaches pupils to be environmentally friendly through reducing, reusing and recycling. Pupils can learn about the various biodiversity around them and what they can do to conserve them. ICT and Multimedia is integrated in the activities when pupils are expected to do projects based on environmental issues.

The club also provides opportunities for the pupils to experience first-hand the process of exploring, investigating and discovering new knowledge in Science. Furthermore, pupils also create products using recycled materials through upcycling projects.

<img style="width:45%" src="/images/clubsandsocieties4.jpg">

The Science and Environmental Club members had opportunities to go for learning journeys to Singapore Botanic Gardens, the Bishan-AMK Park and MacRitchie Reservoir to observe flora and fauna while learning how to preserve the environment. Pupils also get to complete Young Scientists cards to address the issues like climate change, and water and energy conservation.

Students can experience and witness the cycle of converting food waste into usable compost which helps to fertilise the soil in our garden to educate pupils about sustainability education. Students can make posters about environmental events like World Water Day and Earth Day and present in front of their peers or school mates, during the CCA or the school assembly programme.

**Aim:**
*   To promote greater public awareness of and concern for the living and natural environment in our school.
*   To encourage our students to be more environmentally conscious and display a greater sense of environmental responsibility.
*   To arouse curiosity and heighten interest for Science.
