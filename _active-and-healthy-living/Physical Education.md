**Drink Up. Eat Well. Play More** is our unique program to get our pupils to live a physically active and healthy life. We encourage and educate our pupils through a variety of interesting programs and activities to get them to make responsible food choices, hydrate themselves adequately and to play during recess and outside school hours.

**Drink Up** is a whole-school approach where we encourage our pupils to stay well-hydrated by drinking plain water. Every pupil is encouraged to bring a water bottle to school and to drink regularly and according to their body requirements.

**Eat Well** is a food literacy program that we hope to educate our pupils to make informed choices of the food that they are consuming daily. The school has also implemented the Health Promotion Board (HPB) Healthy Meals in Schools Programme (HMSP) since 2016 so as to help our pupils receive the right nutrients necessary for their growing needs.
