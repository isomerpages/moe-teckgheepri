<h3><strong>Parent Support Group</strong></h3>
<p>At Teck Ghee Primary School, our parent volunteers have been a source
of inspiration. Their dedication has enriched numerous school events, fostering
a sense of joy and unity among students, teachers, and families. Their
exceptional efforts during Teachers' Day created memorable experiences
in honoring our educators. They also played a vital role in key programmes
like the NAPFA Test and SwimSafer, supporting our students with care and
enthusiasm. Their commitment to our Food Donation Drive further displayed
their compassion for those in need. Beyond their official duties, they
invested time in building strong relationships and fostering camaraderie.
We are deeply grateful for their unwavering support and the positive impact
they have made on our school and community.</p>

<p>The parent’s involvement in the school sends a clear signal to the students
our deep concern for them. This will in turn encourage them to adopt positive
attitudes towards learning. In the PSG, parents support and learn from
each other. When school personnel and parents work together, they complement
each other’s strengths and gain a common vision towards improving the school
– all for the betterment of our students’ education. The three pairs of
hands in the logo symbolizes the strong partnership between the school
and parents in the interest of the pupils in the school.</p>
