##### **Travel Declaration for 2023 March School Holiday**
------------------------------------------------

Dear Parent/Guardian,

To ensure that schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, we require parents/guardians to make a travel declaration for your child/ward if he/she will be travelling for the holidays.

To make a travel declaration for your child/ward via Parents’ Gateway (PG), go to \[SERVICE &gt; DECLARE TRAVELS\].

Please declare your child/ward’s travel plan(s), indicating both the country and city of travel, and any city of transit, by 10 Mar 2023 (Friday). Only one parent is required to make the declaration.

If your child/ward is not travelling during the holidays, no action is required.

When planning your travel, please refer to&nbsp;[https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart)&nbsp;for more information and updates. If there is a change in travel plan(s) after declaration, please submit a new travel declaration via PG if there is a change in travel destination or inform the school if the travel plan(s) are cancelled.

Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe.
