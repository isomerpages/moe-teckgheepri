### **School Advisory Committee**
Our School Advisory Committee is formed as soon as the school started operational. The members comprises of professionals, businessmen, parents of our pupils, members from parent support group and grassroot leaders. They are most supportive and willing to render their resources and professional expertise to support school programmes. They also help our needy pupils financially. The Committee members are also always there to grace our important school functions and celebrations, such as Open House, National Day Celebrations and Teachers' Day Celebrations .
